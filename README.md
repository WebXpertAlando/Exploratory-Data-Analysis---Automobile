## Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA is an approach to analyze data data in order to:

- Summerize main characteristics of data.
- Gain better understanding of the dataset.
- Uncover relationships between variables and extract important variables for the problem we are trying to solve.
### Question:
  What are the characteristics that have the most impact on the car price?

 We will learn:
 - Descriptive statistics which describes basic features of dataset and obtain a short summery about the sample and measures of the data.
 - Basic grouping of data using GroupBy and how this can help to transform the dataset.
 - The correlation between different variables
 - Advanced correlation, where we can introduce various correlation statistics method, namely:

   1. **Pearson correlation**
   2. **Correlation Heatmaps**
   3. **Predicting Price Using Linear Regression**
